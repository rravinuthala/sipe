Bugs:
	- #2834758: (sip-sec-ntlm.c) First NTLM signature check after startup fails

Big Targets:
	- Native backends other than Purple.
	  * Separate Sipe core and Purple plugin functionality.
	  * New backends: Telepathy, Kopete, Miranda, ???
	- Voice and Video support.
	- Desktop sharing/Live Meeting integration on Windows platform.
	- (?) Email notification.
	- Refactoring to decouple transport/SIP layer (like has been done in http-conn.c)
from SIP-protocol's extensions in form of XML exchange (most notably presense).
So Sofia-SIP could serve as a backend for SIPE. Or otherwise improve SIPE transport 
layer - timeouts.
(In http-conn.c inputs are XML requests, outputs - XML responces or error codes.
All lower level things like socket read/write operations, HTTP message forming, 
NTLM/etc. authertication are all hidded behind http-conn.h API.
So sip-ews.c and sipe-domino.c clients only operate with XML request/responce, they don't care what
is underneath transport at all.) http://www.networkdictionary.com/protocols/osimodel.php - 7 layer
model - that must be taught at university.
	- Update projects site with
	  * SIPE features
          * better/more complete screenshots
	  * page about standards used in SIPE with references
	  * FAQ page.

Call Control:
	- change user state to On Call when line is active and then back
	- answer incoming call (logs required)
	- (?) work with multiple phone lines (not the first one)
	- (?) Call transfer set up, other RCC features from Communicator.
