version 1.11.0 "Lotus Domino/Calendar" (2010-04-XX)
	- Added integration with Lotus Domino (pier11):
	  * Sipe can now retrieve calendar data (Meeting schedule/subject/
	    location) from a web-enabled Lotus Domino server and publish it to
	    OCS2007/LCS2005 as availability information.
	  * Example: "Calendar: Currently Busy. Free at 11:30".
	  * Team members (contacts with access level Team) will be able to see
	    information about our current meeting (subject & location) (OCS2007).
	  * First calendar update is scheduled 1 minute after connect,
	  * Subsequent calendar updates happen in 30 minute intervals.
	  * Manual calendar update can be triggered using the following menu:
		   Accounts->{SIPE_ACCOUNT}->"Republish Calendar"
	  * Though Domino integration can work without any additional settings 
	    in account configuration (on Windows), there are options to manually
	    provide Domino Services URL and email address/password if it's
	    different from SIP URI/Password settings on Basic tab.

version 1.8.0 "Exchange/Calendar" (2010-02-07)
	- Added integration with Exchange 2007/2010. Now Sipe retrieve our Calendar data (Free/Busy, Working Hours, Meeting Subject/Location, Out-of-Office Note) from Exchange Web Services and publishes it to OCS2007/LCS2005. Thus our contacts can see our availability information based on Calendar data. For example: "Calendar: Currently Busy. Free at 11:30" or "Calendar: Currently Free. Outside of working hours at 18:00". Contacts will also see our Out-of-Office message if it's enabled in Exchange/Outlook. Team members (contacts with access level Team) will be able to see information about our current meeting - subject and location (OCS2007).
	First call to Exchange is scheduled with 1 minute delay after Sipe start. Subsequent update intervals are 30 minutes. There is a way to manually trigger Calendar data update: Accounts->{SIPE_ACCOUNT}->"Republish Calendar" menu option.
	Though Exchange integration can work without any additional settings in account configuration, there are options to manually provide email address if it's different from SIP URI, Exchange Services URI, email account authentication if it is different from configuration on Basic tab. (pier11)

	- 2005 presence engine has been completely rewritten. Now it supports "Do not disturb" status(taken from UserState), "In a meetinfg" status (taken from Calendar stream data, and most importantly changing autonomously in line with the stream). "In a meeting" activity reflects scheduled times of activities in Outlook/Exchange with Busy state. Updated 2007 presence engine too. Pidgin Statusbox now reflects last status and note set by our other points of presence; also updates according to our Calendar state (i.e without manual action); displays our Out-of-Office message if any. (pier11)
	- Added "Accounts->{SIPE_ACCOUNT}->Status Reset" menu option to clean User Status set manually. The latter can override Calendar status for example. (pier11)
	- Added "Find on LinkedIn" link on contact's User Info screen for more in-depth information about your contact if available. Both SIPE and LinkedIn.com professional network belong to enterprise domain, so match is quite good. (pier11)
	- Enhanced custom NTLM security provider to pass connection-oriented authentication. Used in Web authentication, for example with Exchange Web Services. In contrast to connectionless (datagram) NTLM authentication type used in SIP. (pier11)
	- Added Negotiate authentication scheme (Windows only). Used in HTTP authentication. (pier11)
	- Contributed code for Adium port. (Matt Meissner)
